This is dotNetPackageManagers TeamCity plugin.

The goal of this plugin is to research and support
.NET package managers in TeamCity. 

We plan to cover mostly nuget and openwrap.

This plugin will be compatible with TeamCity 6.5 and newer


API gaps:
 - Reuse ComposideBuildProcess and DelegatingBuildProcess
 - Use XmlXppAbstractParser#parse(InputSream)
 - Consider reusing of Maven build trigger/project models
 - Make server-side PluginDescription contain getPluginRoot() to avoid cast to PluginInfo
 - Add CustomDataStorage to BuildTriggerDescriptor
