This is dotNetPackageManagers TeamCity plugin.

The goal of this plugin is to research and support
.NET package managers in TeamCity. 

We plan to cover mostly nuget and openwrap.

This plugin will be compatible with TeamCity 6.5 and newer

Supported features:

- NuGet packages installer build runner:
    
  Installs packages with help of nuget install command, according to David Ebbo post 
  (http://blog.davidebbo.com/2011/03/using-nuget-without-committing-packages.html)
  allowing to use NuGet without committing packages to version control.

  Updates packages help of nuget update command


- NuGet Dependency Trigger:
  
  Build Trigger that starts a new build if package is updated.   

API gaps:
 - Reuse ComposideBuildProcess and DelegatingBuildProcess
 - Use XmlXppAbstractParser#parse(InputSream)
 - Consider reusing of Maven build trigger/project models
 - Make server-side PluginDescription contain getPluginRoot() to avoid cast to PluginInfo
 - Add CustomDataStorage to BuildTriggerDescriptor
